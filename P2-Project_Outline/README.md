### Overview
Include overview here


    My application will be a unique and useful program where users will be allowed to search, see reviews, and purchase movies. The app will start by asking the user if they would like to create an account, sign into an account, or continue as guest. However, the app will warn guests that only users with an account will be able to purchase movies. Every user will be allowed to search movies by name or sort movies by any genre. There will be a featured list of popular movies and all movies when the account is signed into. If the user is interested in a movie but does not want to purchase it at this time, they will be able to tag the movie as interested in. Every account will have a watch list where they can see each movie, they have tagged interest in. If the user wants to checkout multiple movies, they can do so by adding the movies to the checkout cart. Once the user is ready to purchase the movies in the checkout cart, they can do so by entering their credit/debit card. After doing so the user will then receive a confirmation email of their order and a date of when the movie will arrive.

    The main goal for this program is to give each user access to an application that is user friendly and creative. I want each user to walk away from our application with the answers they have been looking for. I believe the search/navigation bar will be a very useful tool for any person trying to find the movie they have been dreaming about. While the sort by genres will give users an easy resource to movies, they are interested in. This idea came to me from a love and obsession of movies. I always found it hard to find movies I have been wanting to see on a free application service. Netflix, Amazon, HBO, and other services only allow you to watch movies if you subscribe to their monthly payment plans. Subscribing to them can be a frustrating and sometimes can be difficult to get unsubscribed. With my program users will be allowed to purchase movies whenever they please and wonâ€™t have to make any monthly payment plans.
